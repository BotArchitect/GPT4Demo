# Crawler System Design for GitHub PRs Labeled as "Bugs"

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the design for a crawler system that targets Pull Requests (PRs) labeled as "bugs" on GitHub, aiming to collect and store this data for further analysis or monitoring.

## 2. System Overview
The system will leverage the GitHub API to query PRs, focusing on those tagged with the "bug" label. It will consist of several key components, including API integration, data storage, and a scheduling mechanism for periodic updates.

## 3. Design Components

### 3.1 GitHub API Integration
- **Objective:** Utilize GitHub's REST or GraphQL API to fetch PRs with the "bug" label.
- **Implementation:**
  - Construct and execute API queries to fetch relevant PRs.
  - Handle pagination to ensure complete data retrieval.
  - Manage API rate limits with appropriate strategies, such as request throttling or multiple authentication tokens.

### 3.2 Data Storage
- **Objective:** Store the retrieved PR data in a structured and query-efficient manner.
- **Implementation:**
  - Select a suitable database or storage solution (SQL, NoSQL, etc.).
  - Design the data schema to capture essential PR attributes (e.g., ID, title, author, creation date, status).
  - Implement data insertion and updating mechanisms.

### 3.3 Crawler Scheduler
- **Objective:** Regularly execute the crawler to update the dataset with new and modified PRs.
- **Implementation:**
  - Utilize a task scheduler (e.g., cron jobs, Celery) to run the crawler at predefined intervals.
  - Ensure idempotent operations to prevent duplicate entries.

### 3.4 Rate Limit Handling
- **Objective:** Implement strategies to deal with GitHub API's rate limiting, ensuring continuous operation.
- **Implementation:**
  - Monitor API usage against the rate limit.
  - Employ retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for handling rate limit errors.

## 4. Additional Considerations

### 4.1 Data Integrity and Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling for API interactions, data parsing, and database operations.
- Validate incoming data for consistency and integrity before storage.

### 4.2 Monitoring and Logging
- Set up monitoring systems to oversee the crawler's health and performance.
- Implement detailed logging for operational visibility and troubleshooting.

### 4.3 Security and Compliance
- Secure API access using appropriate authentication methods (OAuth, personal access tokens).
- Ensure compliance with data protection laws and GitHub's terms of service.

### 4.4 Testing and Deployment
- Conduct a range of tests (unit, integration, performance) to ensure system reliability and efficiency.
- Plan deployment with considerations for scalability, load management, and failover capabilities.

### 4.5 Documentation and Maintenance
- Provide thorough documentation covering system architecture, codebase, and operational procedures.
- Establish a maintenance plan for regular system updates and adaptations to GitHub API changes.

## 5. Conclusion
This outline presents a structured approach for developing a crawler system to obtain GitHub PRs labeled as "bugs." The design emphasizes robust API integration, efficient data handling, and system reliability, ensuring the collection of comprehensive and up-to-date data.
